!                   new hydro, cmf, number of bugs corrected
!
!     version: 1.1  july 10th 1996
!                   modified for mixed cmf/sa ,
!                   outer boundary (sa-lines),
!                   density inversion, maximum corrections
!

!                   consistent treatment of p vs. rho including mu(r)
!                   storage of pressure in model-file
!                   check of consistencies of tnew and tact

!                   if itlast.ne.0
!
!                   !!! note that due to a slightly different updating
!                       of xlevel = (ni/nk)*, minor differences in
!                       the occupation numbers will arise if one
!                       compares the results of a calculation with
!                       and without an interupt!!!

!                   to the requirements specified in subroutine
!                   cmfprep. this possibility is used if the parameter
!                   optmixed in the input (the former parameter df,
!                   which has no meaning any longer) is set to unity.
!                   if all lines are to be treated in the cmf, optmixed

!                   update of electron density for ni* (in netmat,
!                   coll. terms) forgotten. inconsistent treatment of
!                   gaunt-factor in opacity (all freq.) and photo-
!                   integrals (only at edge) leads to inappropriate alo.

!                    with WM-basic); Restart capabilities not tested so far  
!                    used only by Jo.
!
!     version: 7.4   june 2003: Vers. 7.2.2 and 7.3 coupled
!     version: 8.0   july 1st 2003: most important metals now "exactly treated, &
!                    T-correction from corresponding transitions 
!                    needs nlte_approx Vers. 5.0, 
!                    (-> new atomic data file-path: ATOMDAT_NEW!)

!     version: 8.1   july 30th: small changes after testing for Bstars;
!                    most important changes: check for TAURLIM and increase
!                    if strong winds; imin, imax for Si.
!                    check also for TMIN1 in module tcorr_var!
!
!     version: 8.2   inclusion of approximate treatment of clumping
!                    different layout of INDAT.DAT required
!                    use nlte_approx version 5.1 and higher
!  
!                    NOTE1: ne, nh and occup. numbers include enhancement-factor,
!                          opacities are corrected
!                          (except FFOPA, which is needed only for T-structure)
!                          to account for spatial averages in RT calculations. 
!                          PAY ATTENTION if line processes are considered, &
!                          particularly in SA, and
!                          whenever local opacities are needed
!                    WARNING: since the energy balance is calculated inside
!                          the clumps (alternative argument: enhancement-factor
!                          cancels out), pay attention if adiabatic cooling is
!                          included, since then the rates MUST be corrected!
!                    NOTE2: not rigorously tested so far. Use at own risk!
!  
!     version: 8.3   changes in INTERMEPHO (calculate heating/cooling rates
!                    without ALO)
!                    XNE -> XNELTE whenever LTE values are used
!                    (to clarify programming)
!                    heating/cooling rates of explicit elements calculated
!                    with NEW occupation numbers (which is more consistent)
!                    START of Sobolev Treatment from it = 4 on!
!
!     version: 8.3.1 improvement of T-convergence, hundreds of tests
!
!     version: 8.3.2 May 2004 
!                    inclusion of DELPARA in calculation of hydro-structure
!                    to account for deviations from power-law in case of
!                    cool stars (Teff < 12000). Now the actual and used
!                    opacities should agree perfectly.  
!                    Note that in this case vdiv is NOT updated, &
!                    thus density inversions are possible. 
!                    Bug in logic concerning OPTNEUPDATE=.FALSE. and T-corr
!                    removed. Ne is now updated to actual LTE density.  
!                    New hack in the calculation of T(hydro). If Tact
!                    is still Tmin, dT is set to zero. This improves the
!                    consistency between Tact and Thydro significantly.
!                    The deviation between both (-> FASTWIND.LOG) should be
!                    now of order of 1%.  
!
!     version: 8.4   August 2004                    
!                    inclusion of formula 46 plus function prhcol
!                    (n, np, z, e), as referred to by
!                      Przybilla and Butler, A&A 2004.
!                    New formula 113 (old H-coll, cf. Burke et al. 1967), 
!                      corresponds to the data given in A10HHe if the
!                      modification as outlined by formula 13 (see below)
!                      should NOT be applied.
!                    This version is applicable to both the optical and the
!                    infrared provided that the correct DETAIL DATASET
!                       is taken; i.e., either
!                    A10HHe (old H-coll. data from Giovanardi et al., &
!                            subr. hcol, formula 13)
!                       or
!                    A11HHe (new H-coll. data from Butler, see above)  
!
!     version: 8.5   Nov. 2004
!                    change in calculation of dqdt partials for explicit
!                    elements to be consistent with nlte_approx.
!                    smaller changes in treatment of inverted levels
!
!                    changes in frescal and fresfin to resolve H and HeI
!                    resonance lines  
!
!     version: 8.5.1 April 2005: Bug in Tratcol (formula 113) identified
!
!     version: 8.5.2 Sept. 2005: Rel diff in cooling changed: at first
!                    differences > 1e-3 are checked, then differences > 1e-4 
!                    abundance changes for explicit and background elements
!                    now from INDAT.DAT (see comments around line 870 and docu.txt
!                    NEW solar abundances from file abundances_solar
!
!     version: 8.6   Oct. 2005: Careful tests concerning clumping performed;
!                    no programming error in original approach from
!                    version 8.2 detected.
!                    Input of clumping-parameters generalized:
!                    Variable number of parameters (up to ten) possible
!                    (e.g., if user changes stratification in subroutine clumping)
!                     parameters now contained in allocated field clf_field) 
!
!                    IMPORTANT: first parameter has to be REPRESENTATIVE
!                    clumping factor which will be ONLY used to find
!                    appropriate HOPF-parameters for calculating the
!                    T-structure in the start-model.
!
!                Correspondance with old approach:  
!
!                clf_field(1)=clf, clf_field(2)=vclstart, clf_field(3)=vclmax 
!
!     version: 8.6.1 Oct. 2005: distribution of radial points changed, 
!                    to better sample the transonic region (for IR!)
!                    xnh precision in GROUND1 changed, to allow for restart
!                    with different (explicit) metal abundances
!
!     version: 8.6.2 Feb. 2006: formula 17 - CBF (needed, e.g., for ground
!                    state ionization of NIII) changed. Note that
!                    there was a bug in the old version!
!
!                    precision of inversion of pure continuum rate eq.

!
!     version: 8.7 March 2006: inclusion of Miguel's version 8.5.2_alpha
!                    treatment of the OP rbf data improved: a new
!		     subroutine (op_setup) takes care of the initial
!		     set up of the OP data. Minor modifications to account for
!		     changes in the frequency grid (see LTE subroutine).
!                    It also checks for differences in the ionization energies 
!                    defined in the input DETAIL file and the OP energies, for
!                    consistency. 
!                    Bug detected and corrected in TRATCOL formula (26), so far 
!                    used only by CIII model atom.
!                    Bug in INTERMECOL formula (17) corrected (Achim),
!                    only affects NIII model atom, so far
!                    Integration limit DEX (subroutine INTERMEPHO) changed to
!                    allow for very detailed model atoms (mainly Norbert's neutral
!                    ions) that have levels with fairly similar energies.

!                    new formualae for Adi's data set 
!                    completely new approach to calculate ILOW, IMAX
!                    new routines ilowimax_lte and ilowimax_nlte
!                    in case, update ONLY ILOWIMAX_NLTE (contained in nlte_approx.f90) 
!                    The old treatment (which is used also for z=0) is
!                    kept in routine ILOWIMAX_OLD (requires "old" detail files)
!                    Now, we make a division between
!                    ILOW, IMAX, IMIA, IMAA
!                    which refer to LTE values and define, e.g., the

!                    ILOWNL, IMAXNL, IMIANL, IMAANL
!                    which refer to NLTE values and are used to solve the 
!                    rate equations. For H and He, both quantities are
!                    identical and calculated in OCCLTE.
!                    Dimensions of xl, partit and occnum corrected.

!                    in module nlte_opt.  
!
!                    subroutine TCORR: calculation of dFerr/dtau improved
!                    for closely separated grid-points
!
!                    subroutine MODVL and MODVL_UPDATE: check that point

!
!                    if UPDATE_STRUCT = TRUE,

!                    test of photospheric clumping with rho_phot = rho_phot/fcl
!                    (constant clumping factor) enabled if OPT_PHOTCLUMP:

!                    (problems occured for cool stars).
!                    New philosophy in MODVL and MODVL_UPDATE to cure problems

!                    911 and 925 A, to ensure a maximum separation of 3 A
!                    (minimum box size for nsubinter = 120  is 3.6 A, can lead
!                    to problems with nlambox_ly when many ions included)
!                    -> changes in FRESCAL (also in dimes.f90)
!

!                    requires additional input with keyword XRAYs (see docu.txt)
!                    K-shell Auger ionization if OPTAUGER = .TRUE. (default)
!                    L/M-shell Auger ionization for higher elements missing ..,

!                    in range 100 eV to 2.5 keV
!                    Tested: explicit and bg elements (if consistent) give very
!                            similar results for ionization fractions
!                    Tested: HHe and other models give very similar results
!
!     version : 10.3.0 October 2014: inclusion of optically thick clumping
!                    (porosity and vorosity), programmed by Jon Sundqvist
!                    included into version 10.2.0  
!
!     version : 10.3.1 missing in standard path. See nlte_v10/standard_10.3
!
!     version : 10.3.2 Feb. 2015: improved freq. grid to allow for
!                    a sufficient resolution between 911 and 1600 A
!                    (particularly Ly_beta) corresponding to v 10.1.7/10.1.7.1
!
!     version : 10.4  July 2016: inclusion of 10.1.7.2
!                     Frequency grid (FRESCAL, FRESFIN) + compiler issue
!
!                     rechanged COPYOCC (e.g. CV/CVI during first iterations)
!
!                     inclusion of new parameterization of X-ray filling
!                     factor, as resulting from the work by Koushik Sen/Jo
!                     when combining the results from Feldmeier et al. 1997
!                     and Owocki et al. 2013.
!                     The present input allows to use the old parameterization
!                     (rho^2 dependence of emissivity in radiative and
!                     adiabatic shocks), and the new one, where the
!                     emissivity in radiative shocks is rho-dependent.
!                     When the parameter PX is set to -1000 or lower, the old
!                     parameterization is used. If p > -1000, the new one is
!                     used, with PX the exponent describing the distribution
!                     of shocks (see Owocki+). For the old description,
!                     FX corresponds to the volume-filling factor, for the
!                     new one to the normalization of the shock-number, n_0.  
!                     The combined, radius-dependent filling factor is now
!                     called FXL
!                     Also updated: electron density for X-ray calculations;
!                     since this density refers to the hot plasma, the
!                     electron density has to refer to completely ionized
!                     Helium (error in Feldmeier et al., but also used in
!                     previous x-ray versions).
!                     Also updated: the input value Rmin refers to units
!                     of Rstar and not to the lowermost radius.  
!
!                     new formula 101 for CBB-transitions implemented,
!                     to allow for an effective reading for tabulated collision-strengths  
!
!     version : 10.4.1 July 2016: inclusion of modifications from CMF-path:
!                     subr. MODVL -- region between 2.0 to 0.2 vs2
!                                        changed to 2.0 to 0.3 vs2
!                                 -- smoothing of v-field at transition point 
!                     subr. CONT  -- flux-error
!                     subr. MODVL_UPDATE: write XNELTE instead XNE to model file
!                     ... and few minor issues
!                     including one bug found by Sarah Brands later on in v10.3.1
!
!     version: 10.4.2 Aug 2016: updated routine CLUMPING from Jon
!                     optically thick clumping generalized,
!                     fvel normalized,
!                     input generalized.
!                     still missing: stop statement to prevent clumping below *sonic* point
!
!     version: 10.4.3 Sept 2016: routine OP_RBFSETUP/CONVOL modified:
!                     improved OP-cross sections when ionization to excited levels
!                     STOP for RBF-formula 101 enforced

!                     new routine INTERMEPHO1.
!                     in brief: split of photo-integrals. For FRE ge FRECIN,
!                     rates towards excited (and, if FRECIN = FRECFN, towards
!                     ground state). Calculated in INTERMEPHO.

!                     rates are called RBF1 in megasalida.
!                     Approach should be a good approximation. It assumes
!                     that largest part of cross-sections (ge FRECIN) relates to
!                     excited or ground-state, whilst lower frequency part
!                     (if present)  corresponds to resonances and relates
!                     to ground-state.
!                     Somewhat wrong if ionization to higher than 2nd stage.

!                     to enforce identical solutions for different elements
!                     (different freq. grids). Driven by a first discrepancy
!                     when calculating HHe, HHeC and HHeN and HHeNC models
!                     (in the HHeC models, HeII did not recombine for d40,
!                      contrasted to the other models)
!                     NOTE: change wavelength when HeII energies are changed
!                     in data-file  
!
!     version: 10.4.6 July 2017: subr. OPACITC modified; calculate

!     You can include own clumping laws by manipulating subroutine
!     clumping (max. number of parameters: 10)  
!
!     note: if new atoms are implemented, provide new formulae in
!           subroutines crossbf (photo cross sections),
!                       intermecol (coll. cross sections (ionisation))
!                   and tratcol (coll. excitation)
!           if necessary!!!
!           also required is update of ilow, imax in routine ilowimax 
!           (_old, _lte, _nlte (latter in nlte_approx.f90))
!
!
!     missing points at present:
!
!   i)calculating taur(nlte)
!  ii)updating of hydro-structure with respect to tau'(nlte)
! iii)(overlapping) lines included in continuum and ionization integrals 
!     maybe important at edges
!  iv) external photospheric structures only for unclumped models (generally)
!

!
! XNH is hydrogen density (total one, HI+HII), independent of LTE/NLTE
!
!-----this program uses three values for the stellar radius:
!--   1) the input value rstar, which is the nominal radius where
!--      tau(-lucy) = 2/3; note that log g  and teff are
!--      also defined with respect to this radius. srnom = rstar * rsun.
!--   2) the lowest value of r(nd) = sr < srnom which is the scaling
!--      radius of the poblem.
!--   3) the radius where the beta-field and the photosphere merge
!--      ("transition point"): srvmin
!--
!--   rtau23 is the ratio of srnom/sr
!--
!
! WARNING!!! program nlte uses

!  abund = n(k)/n(H), i.e. normalized to hyd.

!            program nlte_approx uses   
!  abund = n(k)/Sum(n(k)), i.e. normalized to ntot
!
! Thus, also the value of summass = Sum(abund(i)) in both cases differ!!!

!---- comment from jo: this is an elegant, but not very exact way,
!---- since it is more appropriate for linear interpolation. however,
!---- since log (c*r^n + desh) = log(c'*r^n) with c' = c + desh*r^(-n),

!-----  this subroutine calculates the frequency grid, nh corrected for clumping
!
!       present philosophy requires that EACH level of a DETAILed ion
!       is represented with two corresponding frequencies, namely at
!       the corresponding edge and at edge-epslon(edge)  
!   
!       levmax : maximum number of resolved edges for dominant ions of
!                the two most abundant atoms
!       levmin1: maximum number of resolved edges for 2nd dominant ions
!                of the two most abundant atoms
!       levmin2: maximum number of resolved edges for all other ions
!
!       NOTE: we always count from the highest transition frequency.
!             Two resolved edges means using the 2 highest frequencies.
!             This does not necessarily correspond to the two lowest levels,
!             since transitions to excited levels might lie at higher freqs.
!             Example: SiIII (usually 2nd ion). Highest transitions are
!             Si301->401 and Si304->402
!
!       resolved means here, that we use a sufficient number of freq.

subroutine conv_spec (sx,sy,py,n)

! note1:
! in contrast to the idl routine (convol.pro), we wrap the response function
! around zero, to enable padding in a simple way.
! This is necessary here since we deal with functions which are completely
! non-periodical (s(1) and s(N) have completely different orders),
! in contrast to convolving rectified spectra which begin and end at unity.
!
! note2:
! this routine uses the "slow" way. By exploiting the fact that
! signal and response are real functions, one could save a factor of
! roughly two. Since the convolution(s) have to be done only once per
! frequ. grid, we use here the "standard" way for clarity.
